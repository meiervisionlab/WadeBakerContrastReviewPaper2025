# Measuring contrast processing in the visual system using the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)

This is the github repository that accompanies the paper "Measuring contrast processing in the visual system using the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)"

The paper is published here: (Link to final version on Vision Research Site to be updated).

An author's copy is available from here (Link to the compiled version on Github). 

This paper is provided as a  [Quarto document](https://quarto.org/).

This has some advantages:

* You can see all the code used to generate the figures. Because this document is a review of SSVEP methods, this provides a useful introduction to SSVEP analysis. All this code is available under the MIT license.

* You can recompile the paper into any format you like - PDF, Word etc.. 

* You can check the code used to make the paper. Perhaps we made some mistakes? Feel free to fork and fix. 

* More generally, this is an example of ["Computational Reproducibility"](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/4021) - something that we think would help academic publishing.
